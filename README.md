# NANO Series

## Intro.
The NANO series receivers are the latest low-cost, high-precision positioning solutions from DATAGNSS.

The NANO series supports USB interfaces and can be connected to SBC motherboards like Raspberry Pi. It is plug and play and can be used almost out of the box.

With a specially provided USB Type C cable, NANO can be directly connected to an Android phone for RTK positioning and data acquisition. It supports NTRIP access to your reference station, and transmits RTK positioning data to other devices via Bluetooth or other wired cables.
